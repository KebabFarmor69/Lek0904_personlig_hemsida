      <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
      <h3>Art</h3>
      <p>
        Art came to me when I was a little girl, wanting to express my
        creativity. I started of with aquarelle, as that was what my grandmother
        worked with at the moment. Later on, as I developed my skills, I began
        my journey with acrylics, which most of my paintings are nowadays.
      </p>
      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p>
        For about 5 years I've played handball in AIK and Spånga HK. For the
        past year, I changed to Spånga HK because of personal issues. I find it
        relaxing and refreshing to work out, since it makes me feel strong and
        healthy.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        For most of my life, I've played video games. It varies from
        First-Person-Shooters, to games like The Sims or Cities Skyline. Gaming
        helps my motivation grow and makes me inspired to create different
        artpieces or relax and put my mind of of difficult things.
